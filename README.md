These are the files for my PopOS setup 

[Regolith](https://regolith-linux.org/) brings i3wm to ubuntu and ubuntu-based distros

install.sh: installs regolith, vs-code, spotify, discord, tutanota, todoist, ranger, tweaks, and copies all setting files

The themes are based on [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) and [here's](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jdinhlife.gruvbox) all its color variants for vs code

I got the Regolith gruvbox theme from [this](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-styles) repository where there's many other regolith themes. For gruvbox-light, I simply copied gruvbox and changed the colors

The icons are [Newaita](https://github.com/cbrnix/Newaita)

The GTK themes used are [gruvbox-material-gtk](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material-gtk) for gruvbox and [Pop-gruvbox](https://github.com/salimundo/Pop-gruvbox) for gruvbox-light

The themes can be set through terminal by typing:
* gruv-lo #dark windows with a dark background
* gruv-me #dark windows with a brighter background
* gruv-hi #bright windows with a bright background
